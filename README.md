# Rhabdomyosarcoma fusion oncoprotein initially pioneers a neural signature in vivo
## Overview
This is the code for computational analysis around PAX3::FOXO1 in vivo activity in zebrafish embryos. This code is mean to document the steps involved in running this analysis

The commands used in the code can be found in the cmds folder
The particular files used during the analysis can be found in files directory

The code is split across 4 rmd files

1) P3F_ChIPseq.rmd - Individual P3F and H3K27ac ChIP-seq analysis
2) P3F_ATACseq.rmd - Individual ATAC-seq and Activity-By-Contact model predictions analysis
3) P3F_RNAseq.rmd - Individual RNA-seq analysis
4) P3F_chromseq.rmd - Analysis that requires multiple datasets to have been generated

If you have questions on the study or code, please get in touch with Jack Kucinski, Cenny Taslim, or Genevieve Kendall.
